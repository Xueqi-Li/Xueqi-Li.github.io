I actively welcome motivated undergraduate students at SZU to join my research group. Most students will be involved in collaborations with the following researchers:
- [Dr. Jiawei Wang](https://jiaweiwang-ai.github.io) – Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [NExT++](https://www.nextcenter.org) Lab, National University of Singapore. His research focuses on LLM, and we work together on agent-based recommendation systems.
- Dr. Weiguang Chen – Senior Engineer at Huawei. His research centers on speech signal processing, and our collaboration focuses on incorporating speech features into recommendation tasks.
