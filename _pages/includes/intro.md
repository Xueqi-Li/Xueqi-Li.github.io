# ðŸ˜Š About me
Hello! 
I am currently an [Assistant Professor](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/pages/user/index?id=1339) in the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Shenzhen University.
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology from Hunan University in 2025, under the supervision of Prof. [Guoqing Xiao](http://csee.hnu.edu.cn/people/xiaoguoqing) and Prof. [Kenli Li](http://csee.hnu.edu.cn/people/likenli).
Prior to that, I received my Masterâ€™s degree in 2021 under the supervision of Prof. [Wenjun Jiang](http://csee.hnu.edu.cn/people/jiangwenjun), and my Bachelorâ€™s degree in 2018, both from Hunan University.
From 2022 to 2024, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at Nanyang Technological University, supervised by Prof. [Gao Cong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/gaocong/).

My current research focuses on recommendation systems, especially on serendipity and diversity, aiming to enhance long-term user experience. Moving forward, my work will focus on the following areas:
- **Multi-objective Recommendation.** Exploring methods to improve diversity, fairness, and serendipity in recommendation systems while preserving accuracy.  
- **Multimodal Recommendation.** Incorporating multimodal featuresâ€”especially speech signalsâ€”to enrich user and item representations.  
- **Generative Recommendation.** Leveraging generative models (e.g., diffusion models, large language models) to simulate user behavior, augment data, and enable controllable recommendation generation.
